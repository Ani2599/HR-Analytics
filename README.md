The HR Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze employee attrition, providing key insights into workforce trends and patterns. This dashboard leverages data visualization techniques to display metrics such as turnover rates, attrition causes, and demographic breakdowns. Users can explore various dimensions of attrition, including department-specific trends, tenure-related attrition, and performance-related exits. By integrating interactive charts and graphs, the dashboard enables HR professionals to identify critical areas for intervention and develop strategic initiatives to improve employee retention. This project aims to enhance decision-making processes and foster a data-driven approach to managing human resources.
